## How to contribute?

-   **DO NOT** make and push changes to the main branch!

-   **Always** keep your main/working branch in sync with the main repository `git pull upstream main` on the branch you are working on locally.

-   **Always create a new branch** before making any changes `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>`, never ever make any changes directly on the master/main branch.
